# my-home-lab-reports

This repository is a thorough compilation of penetration testing findings from different home lab setups, such as TryHackMe and others. Every report demonstrates the usefulness of penetration testing techniques, including impact assessment, vulnerability identification, exploitation, and remedial suggestions. By making these reports available, I hope to showcase my proficiency in cybersecurity and ethical hacking, as well as my capacity to identify and defend systems from danger. This repository offers useful insights into my penetration testing capabilities across various environments, whether you're a fellow cybersecurity enthusiast seeking ideas or a potential employer seeking proof of practical skills.
